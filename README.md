# SymulationOfPedestrianDynamics
Simulation of pedestrians movement using cellular automata implemantation in C++

Project for programming course on my faculty. It simulates pedestrain movement in given building. User should give as an argument text files similar to given "proba.txt" and "wartosci.txt". App will show route how simulation was going and return text file with view of room after simulation.
